  <h3 align="center">Welcome to IntelliGrade!</h3>
  <p align="center">An app that calculates a lot of important things with grades!</p>
</p>

## Features

- **Grade Calculation:** Easily calculate your grade based on points.
- **Calculate the grade you need:** Have a bad average and want to improve it? Calculate the next grade you need, along with the specific weight. Our new modal window is designed to calculate the grade you need as easily as possible.
- **Grade increase or decrease:** Often the teacher raises the grades. You can use this function to calculate the raise.
- **Older grade calculation by increased percentage:** Sometimes your teacher will tell you that grades have been raised by 0.5 or even a full grade. These functions allow you to calculate your original grade based on this information.
